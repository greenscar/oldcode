<b>I enjoy visiting your site regularly. The love and care you put into your work is quite evident. There is always something new to see and learn. Your rugs are beautiful and oh so comfy, warm and plush. The artisans on your site are unique and talented. Their works of art are superb. "The Gift of Communication" page is a godsend. I wish you the best in all your endeavors. </b><br>

<b>Hi tam, it was nice to meet you today at montavilla. I got to the gallery from the home page-neat!
Something's going on with the homepage though, I couldn't see the top of the house and tree graphics and the whole page was kind of jumping around.
I viewed it in netscape 4.7 will try IE later.
Our page is at http://i.am/misohapy
see ya later!

<b>Tam--The link to the gallery is not functional--currently it's spelled tamplace/gallery (which won't permit you to go anywhere). I'm smart enough to add the "s", and got in anyway, but you might want to look at your homepage code. Other than that, good work! You are certainly getting better at this!
