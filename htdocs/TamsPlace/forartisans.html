<h3>Artisans invited into this gallery are chosen because their works are original works of art that enrich our lives on more than just the visual level.  These works are things that we touch and use in our daily lives.<P>
The very brief history of the Internet has taught us several things:<P>1)  Confidence in e-commerce is growing, worldwide.<P>2)  Collectives do better, economically, than individual sites. <P>And 3)  Most of what's out there, collectively, is devoid of personality.  We lose sight of the artist and the process of creation.  We see only product and price.  
One of the reasons people shop at shows is because they like to meet the creator, and learn about the process.  I would like to bring these elements into this cyber gallery.</h3>


<h2><B>The Gallery:</B></h2>

<h3>From each artist, a single photo of representative items.  Under each photo, the artist's name and a BRIEF description of works.<P>

By clicking on a photo, the viewer goes to a page with more info and photos about the artist and the process/studio, etc.  Looking for "The Artist at Work" stuff.  Also a great place for background portfolio information (e.g.: galleries, awards, articles, etc).<P>

A "show me more" button takes the viewer into a catalog of only that artists work, with per-item description and prices.  
Hope to eventually offer the option of rotational images and audio, when it is appropriate for the work.<P><P>  

Shopping cart, including credit card payment option (through PayPal) are in place.

<P>When an order is received, the artisan will be notified and will be responsible for shipping the item.  
Requests for custom orders will be forwarded to the artisan.  Once we have delivery confirmation, 
I will send the artisan reimbursement for shipping, plus 5% reimbursement for "handling" fees (packaging, etc.), and 75% of the item's sale price.  </h3><P><P>

<h2><B>Getting started:</B></h2>

<h3>If you already have a website up and running, we can use elements from that site for inclusion, here.  I may 
want a bit more background information about the artisan than many people are including on their personal 
websites, including photos of the artisan at work and materials.<P>

If you do not currently have a website, I need images of your work, materials, methods, and background information.  
I am able to accept current standard floppies, zip discs, CD's or scanable prints.  I can also scan magazine and 
newspaper articles.  You can mail these items to me (or drop them by if you're in the area), or send them by email 
to <a href="mailto:tam@tamsplace.com">tam@tamsplace.com.</A>  For artisans near the Portland, OR area, I can even do the 
photo work for you, if necessary, at no charge.<P>

It should take me no more than a few days for each artisan, depending on volume of their work to be displayed on 
this site.  I currently have no idea how busy I will be, working on this project.  In a perfect world, artisans will trickle 
in, enabling me to tend to each as they come in.  But Life is rarely so ideal, so I expect ebbs and flows.  If you submit 
your work during high tide, there's no guarantee that I can put your things onto the site immediately.  First come 
first served.  I will make every effort to get your work up as soon as possible.  Also, I will give you a chance to 
review layout before posting.<P>

I want to make it very clear, here, that there is no initial investment required from the artisan, beyond responsibility 
for getting images and information to me.  You have nothing to lose, and only potential sales to gain.<P></h3>


<h2><B>The Future of this Gallery:</B></h2>

<h3>Once this gallery is up and running, and large enough to market (8 or 9 artisans) I intend to aggressively market it to any and all applicable web interests 
(eg:  Martha Stewart, Better Homes and Gardens Online, etc.), and some of the larger interior design firms (Ethan 
Allen, etc).  This, again, is the advantage of being a part of a collective.  Not many of us, as individuals, can meet 
the advertising costs or capture the interest of the larger sites.<P>

I also plan to occasionally offer products for sweepstakes.  This has become a powerful draw for internet businesses.
  People like giveaways.  It takes them to new websites and keeps them coming back.  I may eventually ask each of 
  you, in turn, to part with a piece of work for this purpose.  I will be the first, with one of my rugs.  I would 
  appreciate any feedback you have on this idea.<P><P>


So now that you have had a chance to look around a bit and see where I'm hoping to take this, please let me know 
what you think.  Please reply to <a href="mailto:tam@tamsplace.com">tam@tamsplace.com.</a></H3>
