                     <h5>Why Purchase Environmental Insurance?</h5>
                     <p>
                        Most businesses purchase environmental insurance to address specific exposures that could impose
                        substantial financial obligations. The most significant exposures are (1) liability for bodily
                        injury or property damage to third parties; (2) expenses incurred to investigate the sources and
                        extent of environmental impairment and (3) clean-up costs, including ongoing monitoring. Coverage
                        can be negotiated for specific operations or locations and can be arranged to facilitate real estate
                        transactions or business mergers as well as acquisition or divestiture activity.
