                        Durham and Bates has been a leading insurance broker serving the Pacific Northwest for nearly a
                        century. We trace our roots back to 1907, when M.C. Harrison and C.P. Sargent expanded their ship
                        chandlery business to provide Hull and Cargo insurance to shipowners. In 1911, Gilbert Durham
                        purchased the insurance portion of the company. Donald Bates joined him in 1920, formally
                        establishing Durham and Bates.
