                        When was the last time you calibrated your insurance program? Precision and differentiation
                        are the hallmarks of a successful manufacturing company. Your unique exposures and market
                        pressures necessitate tailored insurance coverages to best protect your business. You also need
                        an insurance agent who will become an integral component of your insurance planning, providing
                        advice and consultation on a year-round basis, not just at renewal time.

                        At Durham and Bates, we understand the issues and challenges of the manufacturing industry,
                        from securing your raw materials, to the logistics of distribution and your supply chain
                        to the end customer. You need control and flexibility. You need an insurance broker who
                        understands your need to sustain production.
