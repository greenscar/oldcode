        <p>The D&B office is decorated with an impressive collection of ship models.</p>
        <p>Everywhere you turn you see ships: from Spanish galleons and square-riggers to stern-wheelers and tankers.  Some are so large that they sit in glass cases on the floor; others are sailing or steaming across file cabinets or piles of paperwork.</p>
        <p>The collection is not only appropriate decoration, but contains some remarkable examples of ship model artistry.  One model, a frigate roughly 4 feet long, dates from the Napoleonic era.  English sailors imprisoned in France probably made it.  The ship's hull and superstructure are fashioned entirely from bone scraps from the prison scullery.  The rigging is made of human hair twisted into miniature rope.</p>
        <p><a href="/about/begin.asp">Don Bates</a> was responsible for collecting most of the models.  He did so not only from interest in ship models or because of his business association with the marine field, but also from an interest in the sailor's way of life.</p>
        <p>"In the days of sail," said Bates, "especially on whaling ships, nightfall brought an end to most activity.  Sailors often spent many hours working on projects like ship models or scrimshaw and achieved, in some cases, remarkable products."</p>
