<h3>I. Overview: Internet and E-mail Policy</h3><br>
	<ul>
                <li><h4>The Purpose of an Internet and E-mail Use Policy</h4></li>
                <p>The primary purpose of the policy is to reduce employees’ expectations of privacy and define the boundaries of employee conduct with respect to e-mail and the Internet.  When clearly communicated, the policy protects business because it defines acceptable internet and e-mail behavior.  In addition to eliminating questions around appropriate use, a strong policy mitigates risk of liability by reducing employees’ presumption of privacy.  When employees understand the company’s position on internet and e-mail use, the risk of policy transgression is reduced.</p>
        
                <li><h4>Important Elements to Consider in Implementing an Internet/e-mail Use Policy</h4></li>
                <p>When designing an internet and e-mail use policy, it must be tailored to suit the business needs of your company, reasonable expectations of your employees and a balance of other interests.</p>
        	
        	<li><h4>Clearly Spell Out Privacy Expectations</h4></li>
                <p>Depending upon your business’ position on internet/e-mail monitoring, the policy must be clear in the care and degree of employee privacy practiced.   For instance, if employees should not have a reasonable expectation of privacy, the content should clearly state that the e-mail/internet system is the property of the employer, and management reserves the right to monitor use of the system at any time, at its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p> 
        
                <li><h4>Distribute To All Employees</h4></li>
                <p>No matter what the specifics of your policy, however, the final policy should be given to all employees and placed in employee manuals.  Employee signatures confirming receipt of policies are especially prudent.</p>
