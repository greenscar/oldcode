<h3>IV. A Sample <u>Acknowledgement of Internet and E-mail Use Policy</u></h3><br>
<h4>Acknowledgment of E-mail and Internet Use Policy</h4><br> 
<ul>
	<i>
        <li>As an employee of Employer, I understand that the confidentiality and protection of Employer’s information is of the utmost importance.  I have read and understand Employer’s Policy on acceptable use of e-mail and Internet access.</li>
        <li>If I receive a password for access to e-mail, the Internet or any other system of electronically - stored computer information, I will use it only for authorized purposes.  I agree not to use a code, access a file or retrieve any stored communication other than where explicitly authorized unless there has been prior clearance by an authorized representative of Employer.  I will notify Information Systems immediately if I believe that another person may have unauthorized access to my password.</li>
        <li>I understand that all information stored in, transmitted or received through Employer’s systems of printed or computer information is the property of Employer, and is to be used only for job-related purposes.  I further understand that authorized representative of Employer may monitor the use of Employer’s systems of printed or computer information form time to time to ensure that such use is consistent with Employer’s policies and interests.  Further, I am aware that use of an Employer-provided password or code does not in any way restrict Employer’s right or ability to access electronic communications.</li>
        <li>I am aware that any violation of Employer’s e-mail or Internet Access Policy may subject me to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge from employment.</li>
