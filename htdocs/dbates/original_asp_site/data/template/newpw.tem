<p><b>Welcome to the online services of Durham and Bates!</b></p>
<p>As you requested, a web account has been created for you at DURHAMANDBATES.COM.  
Currently, registered users of DURHAMANDBATES.COM have access to a number of commercial insurance forms
which we hope will speed communications between you and your agent.  
In the coming months we hope to add extended online services, 
including articles, news, and other resources 
which will be customized to your particular needs.</p>

<p>To access the forms please visit the 
<a href="http://durhamandbates.com/public/forms.asp">Forms and Applications</a> area of our website.  
At the login screen you will be asked for the following information:<br>
<br>
ID: #ClientID#<br>
Password: #PW#<br>
<br>
<p>We are excited to offer you this new service.  Please feel free to offer us any suggestions 
about how we could improve this new feature.  As always, if you have any questions or difficulty accessing our website, please feel free to give us a call.</p>
