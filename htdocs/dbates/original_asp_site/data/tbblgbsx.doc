<h3>Workers’ Compensation Holistic Risk Management</h3>
<P>All employers are looking for ways to save money, especially when it comes to health care and workers' compensation.</P>
<ul>
        <li><em>In 1995 the total cost for workers' compensation in the U.S. was almost $120 billion.</em></li>
        <li><em>The average employer spent $2.03 per $1,000 of revenue on workers' compensation costs.</em></li>
</ul>

<h4>Factors That Drive Costs Include:</h4>
<UL>
	<LI>Employers hiring unqualified employees, which increases injuries </LI>
	<LI>The return to work of employees who can resume working is delayed </LI>
	<LI>Employers fail to take control of the workers' comp process, letting it fall into the hands of employees, attorneys and insurers </LI>
	<LI>Workers' comp programs are poorly designed because employers are trying to implement solutions before they know the problem </LI>
</ul>

<H4>New Approach Can Reduce Costs</H4>
<P>In the search for lower costs, employers should consider a holistic approach, developing a comprehensive process in which all parts of the workers' compensation program are interdependent. Well-managed holistic programs have   cut costs by 30 to 80 percent!</P>
<P>Aggressive pre-loss and post-loss management in all areas of workers' comp is important for success in a holistic approach. Pre-loss management includes ensuring safety measures are in place and extensive communication between all employees exists. Pre-loss management can begin at the employment interview, where a potential employee's attitude about workplace safety and return-to-work success can be ascertained. </P>
<P>Post-loss management focuses on how to better manage claims, provide appropriate medical treatment and run an effective return-to-work program. For example, a well-run return-to-work program should return 90 percent of employees to work within four days of an injury.</P>
<p><br></p>
<h4>Communication Is Key</h4>

<OL>
	<LI>Communication between employer, employees, the insurance company and physicians is key to the holistic workers' comp program. Recent studies found that workers who receive information about their company’s program prior to an incident tend to be more satisfied with the process of treatment and recovery and are less likely to seek out an attorney. </LI>
	<LI>Different departments within a company often work against each other without knowing it. To get these departments on the same track and communicate with one another, have a representative from each department serve on a workers' comp team. This will make cutting workers' comp costs a common goal shared by all departments. </LI>
</OL>

<h4>Get Your Employees Involved</h4>
<P>Deciding to take an holistic approach to workers' comp is just the first step in lowering costs. Communicating to employees how this approach helps both them and the company makes a big difference in whether this new approach is successful. In-house communication pieces are a good way to keep employees up to date on your company's workers' comp program. When developing these pieces, though, employers should keep it clear, easy to read and jargon free. Information for employees should be written at a sixth-grade level, while information for management should be written at an 11th-grade level. </P>

<h4>Doctor, Doctor</h4>
<P>Something employers may consider adding to their program is a work-site medical clinic. This will ensure faster treatment for injured employees and help speed up the recovery process. If a clinic isn't possible, refer injured employees to specified physicians. These physicians should be in sync with your workers' comp program and keep in frequent contact with a company representative. </P>

<h4>We Can Help</h4>
<P>Working closely and forming a partnership with your insurer can help make a holistic approach a success. We can work with you to develop pre-loss and post-loss management strategies that will cut your workers' compensation costs and return your employees to work faster after an incident. </P>
