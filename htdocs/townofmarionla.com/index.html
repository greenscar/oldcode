<h3>History</h3>
<p>Marion, one of the oldest towns in Union Parish, was settled by pioneers&nbsp;arriving from&nbsp;Alabama, naming it after their old home county, Marion County, Alabama.&nbsp; The new settlers worked their way across what is now known as the Alabama Landing located on the Ouachita River just east of Marion, La.&nbsp; These new settlers paused their westward movement near the present site of Marion as early as 1830.&nbsp; The earliest known family to settle in the vicinity of Marion was David Stewart, who in 1832 built a log cabin four miles south of present day Marion.&nbsp; Other families began to settle in this area before Stewart left and traveled up the Ouachita River to Camden, Arkansas.&nbsp; They later returned to resettle near Marion.&nbsp; Other pioneer families in the area were the Whittles, who's negroes whipsawed lumber for arriving families building their new homes in the wilderness.&nbsp; Some of the early families arriving were the Repponds and the Briands.&nbsp; The greatest influx of settlers, however, came in the late 1830's.&nbsp; The first record of a land sale was on June 13, 1839 to Pascal Traylor from the United States Land Office for $379.00.&nbsp; The Traylor grant today is the center of the town.&nbsp; Additional families arriving before 1850 were the John Traylors, Powells, Larkins, Georges, Greens, Lunsfords, Adamses, Cooks, Hills, and Thomases.</p>
<p>The honorable L.E. Thomas, born in Marion in 1866, was one of Union Parish's illustrious sons.&nbsp; He was a descendant of these pioneers on his father's side Reverend Sampson B. Thomas and his mother's side Reverend Elias George. He became Speaker of the House of Representatives of Louisiana and State Bank Examiner.&nbsp; Later he served as mayor of Shreveport for eight years.</p>
<p>Dr. John Traylor is&nbsp;known to have built the first store in Marion, and Pascal Traylor the first saw mill.&nbsp; Elias George, one of the foremost Baptist preachers, built the first large house in Marion.&nbsp; The story goes that the preacher purchased a negro slave for $3,000.00 who&nbsp;was an&nbsp;expert carpenter.&nbsp; His expertise and talents were utilized to build the George house.&nbsp; It was in this house that Anna Portesque Harrison, who had&nbsp;arrived from New Orleans as a music instructor for the children of Reverend George, wrote "In the Gloaming."&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1854 a Mr. Hopkins bought the George&nbsp;home.&nbsp; The school system&nbsp;began in&nbsp;Marion shortly before the Civil War.&nbsp; At that time the citizens met and decided to build a school house known as the Bell Academy.&nbsp; Work on the building was halted by the outbreak of the war. &nbsp;However, school was continued in the unfurnished building with Mr. John Hopkins as instructor.&nbsp; Later the building was torn down and the Bell Church, located nearby,&nbsp;was used for a second school house.&nbsp; The history of the school from that time until 1905, when Marion built a two-story frame building, was marked by changing from one church to another for holding school.&nbsp; Since 1905 the school has steadily progressed.&nbsp; It was made an accredited high school in 1908.&nbsp; Destroyed by fire in 1922, the two-story frame buildingn was replaced with a modern brick structure.&nbsp; Around 1945 a school for the negro children was constructed near the Mount Union Baptist Church.&nbsp; This school was later expanded into what became known as the Marion Industrial High School on the site where Oliver Community Center stands today.&nbsp; The school's football team won the 1957 state championship.&nbsp; After integration in 1968, all children in the Marion community began attending the current high school which won the 2005 state baseball championship.&nbsp; Today, with other buildings added, its well-trained teaching force and its large student body, many students coming in by buss from consolidated districts, it ranks with the best in the state.</p>
<p>Marion is located in just a few minutes of several Post-secondary educational facilities.&nbsp; Louisiana Technical College is just 15 miles west of Marion.&nbsp; SouthARK is 35 miles to the northwest and the University of Louisiana - Monroe is just 35 miles to the southeast.&nbsp; Louisiana Tech University and Grambling State University is located 35 miles to the southwest of Marion.&nbsp; Each of these school stand out nationally as a formatable educational institute.</p>
<p>Marion's post office first opened March 18, 1846, was discontinued in 1867, and reopened in 1869.&nbsp; Since then it has operated continuously and furnishes excellent mail service today.&nbsp; There are three thriving churches in Marion: the Methodist, Baptist, and Assembly of God church.&nbsp; Marion has a modern hospital, built by the community.&nbsp; It has a sound bank, a&nbsp;thriving drugstore, and several business firms that would be a credit to any small town.&nbsp; Its leading industries are timber, cattle, and poultry.&nbsp; Most of the year in the vicinity of Marion it is estimated that there are one hundred thousand chickens on feed.&nbsp; Commercial fishing in the nearby Ouachita River is&nbsp;conducted on a fairly large scale.&nbsp; The river is also utilized&nbsp;as a fishing resort for pleasure.&nbsp; With a population of over 800 citizens, it has easy access to the outside world with hard surfaced roads leading out in four directions.&nbsp; Marion is centrally located between El Dorado, Arkansas&nbsp;to the northeast, Crossett, Arkansas to the northwest&nbsp;and Ruston, La to the Southwest and Monroe, La. to the southeast.</p>
