        “It has been 10 years since I graduated.  I have been employed as a police officer, constable, and cattleman’s range officer.  I just wanted to let you know how much I appreciated your classes and what you shared with me.  During my career I have been amazed at how much more I gained from your academy training than those I worked with.  It seemed I was head and shoulders above others when I went to work.  The extra effort and courses you interjected were far more than other training programs.  Thank you so much for getting me started in a wonderful career.”  Graduate of 1995

         “I wanted to let you know that I am so excited about the education I received.  I met someone the other day that works in a Forensic Lab and I was able to carry on a very intelligent conversation with this person.  They asked me how I knew so much about DNA and other forensic knowledge.  I explained where I received my education and he was impressed.  Please do not change a thing with your education and training.  I thought it was hard when I took your course and I did not realize how much I learned until I found myself talking with other professionals.  Please do not let up on the intense training and education you are providing.   Your students will continue to benefit tremendously because of it.”    Graduate of 2005

The instructors you have there are the finest in the state and I will always look back fondly on phrases like “Implements of Husbandry” and “Totality of the Circumstances.”  “Thank you for supporting me in achieving one of my life long goals.”
