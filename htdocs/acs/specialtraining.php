Description: </div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">This course will integrate the lessons learned from the school, business and public arena shootings that have terrorized for decades.  The Active Shooter and the situations set for their devastating strike will be explored.  This course will offer real scenarios for inoculating the public setting against vulnerability, lessening potential damage and laying the foundation for the most effective control by law enforcement.  While there is no set “profile” for the active shooter, the groundwork for their criminality is laid in their past and present. The history of the active shooter and their crimes will be dissected.  Because of this brand of terror, law enforcement needs the skill-set and latitude to effectively contain and neutralize this extraordinary danger.  The skills taught throughout this course contain knowledge, mindset and tactical considerations that provide the on-site and at-the-scene police personnel the tools needed to contain the danger and stop the killing from this active domestic terrorist. This class will begin with the nuts and bolts of practical, tactical and legal considerations.  Throughout these rapidly evolving and devastating events, LEO’s will deal with before, during and aftermath concerns for the intelligent and comprehensive solutions to this problem.  From initial department policy, to the event and through to the community restoration, this course is densely packed with information.  For the operational officer, this course deals with the necessary mental and physical armament and the rules of engagement that are vital in the search and acquisition of this deadly target to stop violence and render situations safe.  For the police command and administrator, this course provides the knowledge in the critical incident response and community integration in the aftermath
