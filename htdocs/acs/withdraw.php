      <div class="bodyHeader">HOW TO WITHDRAW FROM A CLASS:</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         American Crime School understands that in today’s world both professional and personal demands can affect your pre-scheduling events with little or no advanced warnings.  If this situation should possibly occur it could affect the status of the scheduled course causing cancellation of the class.  Although emergencies cannot always be avoided and it is highly unlikely that such an event would affect the schedule course, we have adopted the following withdrawal policies.
      </div>

   <p>
      <div class="bodySubHeader">What happens if ACS cancels a class?</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         In the event or under circumstances in which ACS should cancel a class, all registrant’s would be notified immediately with as much advance notice as possible.  All fees and classroom expenses charged to a student’s credit card will be credited immediately upon cancellation of the class.  All student registration and tuition expenses will be reimbursed.
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="bodySubHeader">What happens if ACS reschedules a class?</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         If a situation should arise where classes have to be rescheduled all participants will be notified immediately of the new course date and location.  All participants that are pre-enrolled will be given first opportunity to reserve seating in the newly rescheduled class.  Students that might have a scheduling conflict with the new course scheduling that prevents the possibility of attending the new rescheduled class will receive a full refund in registration and tuition fees.  At the student’s discretion, a full refund can be obtained or the funds can automatically be transferred to the new rescheduled class.  Should the cost of a rescheduled class increase, the pre-enrolled student will not be liable for any increase in these costs.
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="bodySubHeader">What happens if I am enrolled but unable to attend a scheduled class?</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         Any student that is pre-registered and is later unable to attend, the student should notify ACS at least 14 days prior to the scheduled class.
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="bodySubHeader">Cancellation with more than 14 days notice:</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         Cancellation prior to 14 days before classes begin will allow the student to receive a full refund of registration and tuition costs by ACS check or full credit to your credit card, depending on your method of payment.  An option for the student is to transfer the pre-registered funds toward another future class.  Transferring registration and tuition to a future class will guarantee seating in the class you have chosen as a substitute to your original class.  
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="bodySubHeader">Emergency Cancellation:</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         Should an unforeseen emergency circumstance arise that forces you to cancel your attendance after you have enrolled and paid for a class but within the 14 day window, you will be issued a 100% credit toward any ACS course in the future.  
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="bodySubHeader">For Students that do not Show for Class:</div>
      <div class="bodyParagraph">
         Seating for all ACS classes is limited.  Reservations are accepted on a first come – first serve basis until sold out.  Preference is generally given to credit card enrollments.  Reserving seating with a purchase order or by using ACS check payment option is legally binding.  Failure to attend a class without prior cancellation does not relieve an enrollee’s financial obligation for that class.
