      You will note from the instructor’s biographical data that all ACS personnel are law enforcement personnel and/or professional educators.  We are proud of our service records and our affiliation with leaders in the field of law enforcement, forensic science, and the neuropsychological world of advanced training and education.  Our teams of professional instructors are heavily involved in up-to-date research or are practitioners in the world of law enforcement, criminal psychology, and forensic science.

      The staff at ACS is dedicated toward the idea of the “new school” approach.  With our staff we are enhancing the class room with up-to-date materials, research, and technical skills needed to enhance the professional’s working environment in the field.  With the “new school” approach we have combined three disciplines that compliment each other.  Law Enforcement, Science, and Psychology have a very meaningful purpose when used together.  Law enforcement is not only the protectors of society but they are the investigators for criminal activity.  By mixing science and psychology with law enforcement you help create an officer with a much broader perspective about criminal behavior and the criminal mind with reference to profiling their behavior and forensically analyzing evidence found at the crime scene.  Enhancing the ability to identify what is evidence at a crime scene can gain an advantage during the collection process and this helps lead the investigation in the direction of identifying the perpetrator.  This is a new school approach and it is rapidly gaining success all over the world.
