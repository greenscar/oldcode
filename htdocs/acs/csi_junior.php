        CSI-Jr is a forensic program designed to create an interest in Forensic Science at the high school level.  Professors of Forensic Science will visit your high schools and cover many topics related to Forensic Science as a career field.

        It is our intention to try and encourage student at a very young age to get involved in Forensic Science.  We have visited many high schools in Texas and have expanded the program in 2007 to include many other states.
