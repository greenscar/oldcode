  Photography by Design is a full service wedding and portrait studio located in the Historical Heights, at 626 West 20th Street, Houston, Texas. Wayne Sandlin, the owner started working as a Wedding and Portrait photographer in 1970, and still finds every wedding as unique and exciting as his first.  All Wedding packages are built to fit the Brides special requirements and needs.  We build all of our wedding packages starting with complete coverage of the wedding service and reception. You will always have two photographers to give you both traditional color formals and candid images and the artistic, photojournalistic black and white.  Your wedding package will always be covered with unlimited images captured during your event.  We will build into your package both Engagement and Bridal Portrait Sessions if you request. Portrait sessions can be captured in our studio or at the location of your choice. If you chose a Bridal Album we will build to be the album of your dreams. A complete collection of your Engagement and Bridal images along with all of the images captured during your Wedding and Reception can be put in printable format on a CD for you to own and have photographs printed from. Call our Studio at 713.455.8833 or email us at pbyd@pbyd.com for more Wedding or Portrait information.
