            by Design is a full service wedding and portrait studio located in 
            the Historical Heights, at 626 West 20th Street, Houston, Texas. Wayne 
            Sandlin, the owner started working as a Wedding and Portrait photographer 
            in 1970, and still finds every wedding as unique and exciting as his 
            first. All Wedding packages are built to fit the Brides special requirements 
            and needs. We build all of our wedding packages starting with complete 
            coverage of the wedding service and reception. You will always have 
            two photographers to give you both traditional color formals and candid 
            images and the artistic, photojournalistic black and white. Your wedding 
            package will always be covered with unlimited images captured during 
            your event. We will build into your package both Engagement and Bridal 
            Portrait Sessions if you request. Portrait sessions can be captured 
            in our studio or at the location of your choice. If you chose a Bridal 
            Album we will build to be the album of your dreams. A complete collection 
            of your Engagement and Bridal images along with all of the images 
            captured during your Wedding and Reception can be put in printable 
            format on a CD for you to own and have photographs printed from. Call 
            our Studio at 713.455.8833 or email us at pbyd@pbyd.com for more Wedding
