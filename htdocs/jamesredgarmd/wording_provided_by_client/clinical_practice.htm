Dr. James R. Edgar <br>
Dr. Edgar&#8217;s clinical practice is based on the belief that skilled<br>
and experience psychiatrists are best able to completely and<br>
comprehensively evaluate patient conditions and devise<br>
treatments that work in a real-world context. The special patients<br>
Dr. Edgar treats are generally able to continue their full and<br>
productive lives as they improve their psycho-social health. In his<br>
practice, psychoanalytical treatment precedes and provides a<br>
basis for medication, if warranted.<br>
