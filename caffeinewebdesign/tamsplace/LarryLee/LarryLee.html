Wisconsin.  Having lived in Hawaii for 20 years the ocean has played an important part in his life.  His love of snorkeling, fishing, and exploring the beaches, have come together with his interest in stained glass in the creation of these unique shell boxes.The base of the box is made with the same techniques used to make Tiffany-style lamps.  Larry always liked the looks of these lamps, and one day when he was in college he picked up a book at the library on how to do it. And the rest, as they say, is history.He originally made boxes with the tops made of stained glass panels in "Hawaii" designs;  flowers, palm trees, seashells, etc.  One day a customer suggested he use a real shell.   He tried it, and they proved to be very popular, so he has continued.He purchases high quality seashells, adds a hinge to the back and then custom-builds a base to conform to the irregular shape of the shell.  The side slats are clear double strength window glass and the bottom is mirror.  All the pieces are wrapped with copper foil and then soldered together.</TD><TD ALIGN=top right WIDTH="310"><IMG SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/LarryLee/ToolsNMaterials.jpg"><BR>Tools of the trade:  Glass cutter, mirror, soldering iron, seashells, metal file, solder, and Band-Aids!</TD></TR></TABLE><P ALIGN="LEFT"><TABLE WIDTH="675"><TR><TD WIDTH=300><IMG HEIGHT="209" WIDTH="300" SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/LarryLee/CuttingMirrorBase.jpg"><BR>The mirror is cut in the same shape as the shell.</TD><TD>The boxes are a wonderful place to put that favorite piece of jewelry.  They also work well on a coffee table to hold wrapped candies or in the bath as a container for decorative soaps or cotton balls.  They've even found a use in Larry's new homeland, Wisconsin... You guessed it!  Cheese containers.</TD><TD WIDTH = 200><IMG HEIGHT="209" WIDTH="200" SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/LarryLee/CuttingShell.jpg"><BR>Cutting the shell can be a tense moment!<BR></TD></TR></TABLE><P><TABLE WIDTH="750"><TR><TD><IMG HEIGHT="208" WIDTH="200" SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/LarryLee/SolderingSides.jpg"><BR></TD><TD>Left:  Side slats are clear double-strength window glass.
