WWWboard By Matt Wright

#Get all the files


Files Include:

msgs.html
msgs.cgi
postfp.cgi
followup.cgi

#Edit and configure all 4 files needed for this program.

#change all references to yourdomain.com to your domain

#change all references of your domain to    your name or your domain name

#Install all the files in a subdirectory of your root directory, preferably named wwwboard as the scripts are already
partially configured for this.


#In addition you will need to create an additional directory in the wwwboard directory named messages

#chmod 777 both the wwwboard directory and the messages directory
#chmod 777 msgs.html
#chmod 755 all three .cgi(s)

#This should work
