    <TD align="BOTTOM LEFT"></FONT><FONT face=arial color=#cccccc size=+1>Taught by my father to work in
different mediums and with different subjects, PEOPLE have become my favorite subject of study
over the years.  I am inspired by the sense of spirit found in all of us, and entertained by 
candidness caught on film.  Not unlike Norman Rockwell, who did his work from photographic reference, I feel
that EVERYONE is a work of art! </FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><P>

      apple doesn't fall far from the tree. My father, shown in the storage room 
      at his highschool, displays one of his first portraits, done in oils. 
      Though he has mastered most mediums, his passion is in painting and he 
      still paints today.

my privilage and pleasure over the years to take your favorite photos, and bring them to life
 through my renderings.  These portraits are a one of a kind gift for yourself and others.</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>
<P></FONT><FONT face=arial color=#cccccc size=+1>
My portraits are done with a PHOTO REFERENCE ONLY.  They are done in watercolor on watercolor
paper.  For pencil renditions, they are done in graphite/lead on acid-free Bristol board and treated with a non-smudge finish.
Both are packaged between two foamboards in a clear plastic cover so that it can be stored easily
and safely until framing.<BR>

face=arial color=#cccccc size=+1>PRICES FOR PENCIL are as follows: For one torso or 
shoulder and head of a person, the charge is $100. For a whole body, or 
intricate background, add $25. If you desire a group shot (which can be done 
with a single photo, or several photos), AND there are more than four people 
(head and torso), the price drops to $75 per person.

<FONT 
face=arial color=#cccccc size=+1>HERE ARE SOME HELPFUL HINTS WHEN CONSIDERING 
HAVING A PROTRAIT DONE:<BR><BR></FONT><FONT face=arial color=#cccccc 
size=+1>PHOTO REFERENCE Clearness and sharpness of photo is important.  (For a watercolor, 
a color photo is required for reference.) I can 
usually work with emailed copies or photo copies when the quality of the picture 
is maintained. The unique and candid snapshots supply me with a great deal of 
spirit and personality. Black and white photos are always exciting to do, but 
most importantly, if it is a favorite of yours, there's a good chance it will be 
a winner like these!<BR><BR></FONT> 
<BR><BR><FONT face=arial color=#cccccc size=+1>TRANSACTIONS can 
be done by mail or other means of shipping, especially if you are out of the Portland area. 
With the shipping included in the agreed upon portrait price and deadline, a 
post dated check can be sent to me. The check will be cashed upon verbal 
acceptance of the artwork.  We can correspond by email or phone until the transaction
is completed.<P>
