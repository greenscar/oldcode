<strong>Shopping Cart Message </font></strong>

</font>
            <p><font color="black" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">

You have been directed to this page for one of two reasons:
</font>
            <ol>
              <li><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">You have not put anything into your cart, or</font>
              <li><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">Your browser is not accepting cookies.</font></li>
            </ol>
            <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">

Regarding the first reason, you may be asking to &quot;View Your Cart&quot; without having successfully placed anything into it. If this is the case, return to the site's shopping pages and try again. Place items into your cart by clicking a
&quot;Buy&quot; button or &quot;Add to Cart&quot; button next to the item you wish to purchase. This action will &quot;initialize&quot; your cart so that you can view it.
</font>
            <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">

If you have, in fact, successfully placed at least one item into your cart, then you have been directed to this page for the second reason--because your browser did not accept our cookie. Your browser settings may be configured to refuse cookies being
sent to it, or you may have manually refused to accept the cookie when prompted to accept or decline it. Alternatively, your browser may have lost our cookie's reference to your order, but that situation is quite rare.
</font>
            <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">

At any rate, in order for you to purchase items on this site, it is necessary for your browser to accept our cookie, which in this case is a harmless reference number that corresponds to your order. The number is meaningless, and it contains absolutely no
information about you, your internet activities, email, or anything else. The number has meaning only to the shopping cart system, and only while you are shopping on this site.&nbsp;
</font>
            <p><font color="#000000" face="Arial,Helvetica" size="2">

Please check your browser settings to ascertain that it will accept cookies. Access these settings in Internet Explorer through Tools/Internet Options/Security/Custom Level/Cookies: Enable.</font></p>
