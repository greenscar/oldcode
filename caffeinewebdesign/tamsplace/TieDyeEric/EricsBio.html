Some of what's not shown:  White clothing ("the canvas"), lots of buckets of clean, hot water, washer/dryer, scissors, dye powders, and soda ash barrel.</TD><TD VALIGN="top"><IMG SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/TieDyeEric/Bio/FirstEver.jpg" ALIGN="Right" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="300"  ALT="First Shirt Ever Dyed">The first shirt Eric ever tie-dyed, as a 4th-grader in 1966, still hangs in his workshop (Right).<BR>"I grew up in a liberal family, and always had my artistic side exposed and encouraged,"  says Eric.  He grew up with his hands in clay and paint, and learned that it's great to make a mess and something awesome at the same time.  In 1989 he got a tie-dye starter kit for $20.  It had golden yellow, blue and red dyes -- a very basic starter kit.  He had to mix-his-own for orange, green and purple.  He started out just dying shirts for himself, but soon he was also making them for family and friends.  A few months later, a band called "The Grateful Dead" came through Southern California, and Eric decided to take a few  of his shirts along to the concert.  He  sold out quickly -- all twelve of them in less than an hour. When it was over he'd seen a great concert, met a bunch of really cool people, and he had $120 in his pocket.</TD></TR></TABLE><TABLE cellspacing=10><TR><TD WIDTH="178" VALIGN="top"><H2>The Spiral</H2><IMG HEIGHT="91" WIDTH="178" SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/TieDyeEric/Bio/SpiralingB.jpg" Alt="Starting the Spiral"><BR>The basic spiral starts with the soda-ash-soaked shirt lying open and flat.

The next show he went to, he took three dozen shirts, and again he quickly sold out.  He knew he could do well in the "Wild West," but wasn't sure how the rest of the country would take to them.  In 1991 he drove from San Diego to the Pine Knob, Michigan Music Ampitheater (a 5-day drive) to see how he would do in with a Mid West/East Coast crowd.  After three days he had sold out and had made over $3,000.  Yep, the rest of America likes his work too...  That's when he started a 10-year travelling life.  "I saw America with the Grateful Dead," he says.  In one year alone, 1993, he sold his shirts at 56 Grateful Dead shows in 32 cities.  He's hoping that more internet exposure will enable him to reconnect with some of the terrific people he met "on the road."  He's hoping to get "then and now" pictures of his shirts, if he can find people out there who still have some of the old ones.... If you "knew him when..." you can <a href="mailto:tiedyeeric2001@yahoo.com,tam@tamsplace.com">email Eric here</a>!)<BR><BR>After ten years of juggling the "Dead life on the road" and a career as a chef, he decided to get serious about tie dying as a career.  He moved from San Diego, California, to Portland, Oregon, and "my business went ballistic.  I feel like I moved to the Mecca...  the Homeland of tie dye clothing."  He now tie-dyes full-time.  "Every waking moment I live and dye in 3/4-time...  It's pretty fun!"  He feels lucky and blessed, and his work reflects this:  Some of the most gorgeous tie dye available!<BR><BR><IMG HEIGHT="273" WIDTH="369" SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/TieDyeEric/Bio/SqueezingDyeIn.jpg" ALT="Squeezing in the dye."><BR>The Heart, tied and dyed.</TD><TD WIDTH="178" VALIGN="top"><H2>The Heart</H2><IMG HEIGHT="93" WIDTH="178" SRC="http://www.tamsplace.com/TieDyeEric/Bio/HeartStencilB.jpg" ALT="Heart stencil">After soaking in soda ash solution, a t-shirt is carefully flattened, and folded in half.
