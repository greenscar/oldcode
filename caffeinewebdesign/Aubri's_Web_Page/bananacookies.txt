  Sift together:
  1 scant cup of Whole wheat flour
  1.5 tsp baking powder
  dash salt
  1 tsp cinnamon
  dash nutmeg
  1-2 tbsp sesame seeds (optional- really
    taste good, and add protein for you vegans)
  
  Blend wet ingredients in blender. mix dry and wet.  Stir in 3/4 c. oatmeal
  (the regular cereal type) stir in 2 tbsp raisins (optional but delicious)
  
  Drop by generous spoonfuls onto cooking-sprayed cookie sheet.
  
  Bake at 350 for 20-30 min or until just browning.  (without the oil they
  take longer to bake than you think!... check them though after 15 min to
  see how they are doing)
  
  TA DA!!!   This recipe has worked very nicely for me twice.
