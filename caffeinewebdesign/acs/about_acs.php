           About ACS
    </div>
    <div class="bodyParagraph">
        American Crime School was founded out of a demand to provide up-to-date as well as the most advance and accurate education and training to law enforcement personnel as well as other professionals interested in a forensic application against criminal activity.  The forensic world is changing almost on a daily basis.  In the past twenty years there have been amazing advancements in forensic technology that has been exhausting just to keep up with.  New career paths have developed in the forensic world providing new opportunities to crime scene technicians with a two-year degree.  Many major cities have taken note of the need for advance forensic training both as a career path but most essential as a first responder to a crime scene in an effort to preserve as much of the crime scene as possible.  Courts and jurors are no longer just taking the word of the professional police officer.  Courts and jurors are demanding a forensic link between the evidence and the crime scene.  Defense attorneys are taking advantage of this fact when there is no forensic link between their clients to the crime scene.

        ACS personnel have spent their adult lives as law enforcement and educational professionals but they have also spent the past few years in intense research relative to forensic training and neuropsychology.  ACS founders are responsible for creating the first Associate Degree program in Forensic Science in the state of Texas for a two-year higher education institution.  Over 12 Community College campuses in Texas are following suit by implementing an Associate Degree Forensic Science program at their respective institutions.  ACS personnel are the leading consultants in that charge.

      The staff at ACS is dedicated toward the idea of the “new school” approach.  With our staff we are enhancing the class room with up-to-date materials, research, and technical skills needed to enhance the professional’s working environment in the field.  With the “new school” approach we have combined three disciplines that compliment each other.  Law Enforcement, Science, and Psychology have a very meaningful purpose when used together.  Law enforcement is not only the protectors of society but they are the investigators for criminal activity.  By mixing science and psychology with law enforcement you help create an officer with a much broader perspective about criminal behavior and the criminal mind with reference to profiling their behavior and forensically analyzing evidence found at the crime scene.  Enhancing the ability to identify what is evidence at a crime scene can gain an advantage during the collection process and this helps lead the investigation in the direction of identifying the perpetrator.  This is a new school approach and it is rapidly gaining success all over the world.
