   		ACS-2441 Narcotics and Controlled Substances:  Highway Interdiction:
   </div>
   <div class="bodyParagraph">
		This is an 8-hour intensified training program that will fine-tune the patrol, law enforcement, or narcotics officer in identifying all types of vehicle concealment compartments and show you exactly where to look for concealed narcotics and contraband.  The most widely used and best mode of transporting narcotics is by vehicle.  Statistics indicate that only 1 out of every 100 vehicles is caught transporting narcotics.  Since the introduction of NAFTA (North America Free Trade Agreement) with Mexico, commercial trafficking has increased from 100,000 vehicles to over one Million vehicles crossing just one check point and traveling through Texas, New Mexico, and California to all areas of the United States.  All major corridors are avenues for narcotics trafficking and your community is a dropping off point.
		<br>
    	The student will learn driver demeanor and how to avoid distractions in order to help the officer focus on identifying narcotics traffickers.  By knowing what to look for and where to look is the KEY to making large narcotics seizures on the highways and in your community.  This course is a must for every officer wanting to know how to determine if a vehicle is transporting narcotics or other contraband.  The instructor has over 25 years experience in law enforcement dealing with vehicle searches and seizures of narcotics and is recognized as an expert in this area.  The instructor has literally been involved in hundreds of large narcotic seizures

   <div class="bodyParagraph">
        This is a 40-hour course of instruction for Bloodstain Pattern Analysis Basic Course.  The course of instruction is designed for investigators, crime scene technicians, forensic technicians, and other involved in criminal and medical-legal investigations and crime scene analysis.  The course is intended to develop a fundamental knowledge of the discipline of bloodstain pattern analysis.  The course should illustrate to the student basic principals of bloodstain pattern analysis and the practical application of the discipline to actual casework.  The course syllabus is not intended to create an “instant” expert.
		<br>
		Course objectives:  Upon completion of the course the student should:
		<ul>
			<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the development, history and advancement of bloodstain pattern analysis.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the inherent limitations of bloodstain pattern analysis.</li>
			<li> Recognize key bloodstain patterns and understand the mechanism by which they are created.</li>
			<li>Determine impact angles for individual bloodstains.</li>
			<li>Determine a probable point (area) of convergence for a group of bloodstains.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate the ability to combine point (area) of convergence with impact angle to locate the probable point of origin for a given blood spatter event.</li>
			<li>Recognize proper protective measures to follow in a bloodstained scene.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate knowledge of the methods of documenting bloodstain scenes, both photographically and in written format.</li>
			<li>Demonstrate an ability to evaluate a basic bloodstain pattern scene.</li>
