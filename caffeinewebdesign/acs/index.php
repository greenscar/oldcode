                       The American Crime School was founded out of a demand to provide up-to-date, as well as the most advanced and accurate education
                       and training to law enforcement personnel, and other professionals interested in a forensic science application against criminal
                       activity.

                       The professionals at the American Crime School have made a commitment to deliver a training program in which the students go
                       away educated and feeling that their effort was well worth the time spent enhancing their knowledge. ACS demands that students
                       go away with the education and skills they need to enhance their career.

                       The staff at ACS is dedicated toward the idea of the “new school” approach. With this approach, we have combined three disciplines
                       that compliment each other: Law Enforcement, Science and Psychology, they all have a meaningful purpose when used together.
