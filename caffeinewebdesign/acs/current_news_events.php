            Official Signing of Articulation Agreement with The University of Texas at Arlington.
        </div>
    </p>
    <p>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Lum Farr and Don Jacobs, founders of American Crime School and with their colleague Erin MacKenzie created the first forensic science degree program for a Community College in the State of Texas
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Additionally, Mr. Jacobs and Mr. Farr helped establish a seamless degree transfer program to the University of Texas at Arlington.  Through an articulation agreement with UTA students from all over Texas and the world can now attend UTA and complete their studies with one of the most creative degree programs in the world.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            This interdisciplinary degree program is tailor made for the forensic students.  No matter what the student’s interest, UTA helped us develop a Bachelor of Art or Bachelor of Science degree to fit their needs.  
        </div>

        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            The articulation agreement allows students a seamless transfer from WC to UTA beginning in the spring semester 2007.  UTA will offer WC students two innovative interdisciplinary degrees.  The Bachelor of Science degree will focus on Criminalistics, or the laboratory application of forensic science.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            “This is exactly what Weatherford College needed to take our program to the next level,” said Dr. Richard Bowers (right), WC dean of math, science, and technology.  “Our alliance with UTA will give our students the perfect interdisciplinary degree to expand their knowledge in so many exciting fields within forensic science.”
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Dr. Repko remarked that he was “very pleased with the WC alliance.  Additionally, we will offer a three-hour intern course that will allow students to pursue on-the-job training prior to graduation.  This type of experience has never been available before.  In fact, our agreement with WC will be used as a model for additional articulations with other campuses in the future,” he said.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            In March 2004, with the vision of Don Jacobs, (Department Chair of Psychology, and Forensic Science), Erin MacKenzie (Micro-biologist and Forensic Science Lab Director) and Lum Farr (Department Chair of Criminal Justice and Forensic Science Lab Coordinator), Weatherford College became the first community college in Texas to offer a fully transferable Associate of Arts emphasis in forensic science.  Since the, 10 colleges throughout the state have followed  the WC model.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Don Jacobs and Lum Farr, seen standing in the photo, both state that they are extremely pleased with this alliance.  “This is just one step in the many steps we have taken and plan to take in developing forensic science for the two year Institutions in the state of Texas.  The development of the AA degree and the alliance with a major university are just some of the rewards we have felt throughout the past three years.  The founding of American Crime School and all the networking throughout the state has been very rewarding for both of us”, said Lum Farr.

        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Dear American Crime School:
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Thank you for giving me the opportunity to visit your campus at Weatherford College. I applaud the efforts of your WC Forensic Science Group to institute forensic science programs at college campuses within the state of Texas. The level of sophistication that forensic science has brought to criminal investigations is awesome. But one cannot lose sight of the fact that once one puts aside all the drama of a forensic science case, what remains is an academic courses emphasizing science and technology.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph"> 
            Forensic science strives to make the technology of the modern crime laboratory clear and comprehensible to students of criminal justice. The nature of physical evidence is studied, and the advantages that technology imposes on its individualization and characterization are important areas of study for modern criminal investigators. By combining case histories with applicable technology, forensic science can capture the pulse and fervor of a variety of criminal investigations.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Only by combining the knowledge of the principles and techniques of forensic science with logic and common sense will a criminal investigator gain comprehensive insight into the meaning and significance of physical evidence and its role in criminal investigations. Forensic science begins at the crime scene. If the investigator cannot recognize, collect, and package evidence properly, no amount of equipment or expertise will salvage the situation.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Likewise, there is a dire need to bridge the “communication gap” that currently exists among lawyers, judges, and the forensic scientist. An intelligent evaluation of the scientists’ data and any subsequent testimony will again depend on familiarity with the underlying principles of forensic science.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">
            Your efforts are important and noteworthy for the continued successful implementation of forensic science into the criminal justice system.
        </div>
        <div class="bodyParagraph">Regards,</div>
