                        <h5>Why Purchase Directors and Officers Insurance?</h5>
                        <p>
                            Directors and Officers are at risk of personal liability claims arising out of their position,
                            regardless of whether the company is privately or publicly held.  While the company often provides
                            indemnification, it may not be available for either legal or financial reasons.  As a result, most public
                            companies and many private firms purchase Directors and Officers Liability Insurance to supplement the
                            indemnity offered by the organization.
                        </p>
