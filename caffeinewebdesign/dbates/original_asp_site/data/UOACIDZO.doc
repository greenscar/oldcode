<h4>Distinctive Solutions Seminar Series</h4>

<b>Durham and Bates</b> believes the distinction of <b>COMPLI</b>'s program is its new level
of interactivity, allowing employees more control in the administration and
authorization of their employment-related documentation.  We've worked with
<b>COMPLI</b> to present a Fall 2001 seminar series to our customers and other business
partners.  We believe ideal firms for <b>COMPLI</b> are those that employ more than 50;
are technologically savvy, and diligent about employment practices liability.
