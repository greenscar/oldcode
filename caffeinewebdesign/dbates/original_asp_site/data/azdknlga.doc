<h3>Make sure you are reporting new hires correctly</h3>
<hr>
<p>Effective October 1998, changes to the Federal Welfare Reform package imposed some new responsibilities on employers.</p>
<p>In 1996, federal law set up provisions to assist the operation of a national directory so that the federal Office of Child Support Enforcement could locate parents defaulting on child support obligations. The statute requires that all employers report new hires within 20 days of hiring to the appropriate state agency. In Oregon,that state agency is the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>You cannot comply with this law by doing your regular quarterly filings-you have to make the report within 20 days.</p>
<p>The following information is required: employee name, employee address, employee social security number, employer name, employer address, and employer federal tax I.D. number.</p>
<p>If you have employees in more than one state and take advantage ofreporting magnetically or electronically, you can designate a single state in which to file reports as long as you notify the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<p>The easiest way to comply with this requirement is to send a copy ofthe W-4 form to the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Here's what you can expect: after you report new hires, the Departmentof Justice will compare your reports with records of support obligations being enforced through that agency and, if there is a match, you will quickly receive notification that you must begin to withhold the child support obligation from your employee paychecks.</p>
