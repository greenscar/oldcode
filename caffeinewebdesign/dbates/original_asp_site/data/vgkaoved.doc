<h2>Healthcare Industry Faces Increased Environmental Risks</h2>
<p>From AIG's <b>SALES POWER UPDATE #3</b> (2/7/2000)</p>
<hr>
<p>Traditionally, when it comes to environmental contamination, healthcare facilities have not been the focus of government agencies or watchdog groups. However, as attention spreads from industrial manufacturing, healthcare has found itself subject to increased regulation. This heightened scrutiny is uncovering exposures and holding healthcare companies, owners and operators of facilities responsible for environmental liability.</p>
<p>Despite regulation, these liabilities are more likely attributable to the increase in industry waste and related management and disposal risks. A growing and aging population, a demand for medical procedures and new technologies, all contribute to the increase in medical waste. The healthcare industry generates waste through the various materials, technologies and processes used to improve health and save lives. The waste is usually bio-hazardous in nature. The production, treatment, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of this waste carry significant risks that have the potential for environmental liability.</p>
<p>In recent years healthcare facilities have paid out millions of dollars in damages resulting from improper waste management or disposal and subsequent cleanup. Given the hazardous nature of this waste, a mishap can contaminate property, spread infectious disease and cause serious permanent injury. In such situations, companies have been held responsible for losses and injuries to workers, patients, visitors, and other potential victims of exposure to the environmental hazards.</p>
<h3>Real Risks &amp; Liability of Medical Waste</h3>
<h4>Ignorance of Waste Laws</h4>
<p>The inspection of 214 healthcare facilities in one state revealed that 56% of doctor's offices, 69% of dentists, 90% of veterinarians, and 87% of funeral homes do not properly handle or dispose of their medical waste. Common violations included a disregard for: placing fluids and sharp waste in required moisture-proof and puncture-proof containers, sending waste to proper disposal facilities, and maintaining adequate records. Ignorance of the law was sited as the primary reason for most of the violations, some of which resulted in liability for third-party bodily injury, property damage and clean-up costs.</p>
<h4>Carelessness in Waste Disposal</h4>
<p>A healthcare facility sent what appeared to be 15 drums of ordinary medical waste for incineration. However, the contents turned-out to be slightly radioactive and therefore should have been disposed of as radioactive waste. The oversight occurred when the waste was scanned solely with a gamma radiation detector. The contaminants, which emitted alpha and beta radiation, went undetected. Remediation costs have yet to be determined. In similar situations, incinerators produced millions of cubic feet of radioactive contaminated ash and sludge with cleanup costs in the millions and even billions of dollars.</p>
<h4>Violation of Safety Rules</h4>
<p>Throughout the 1990's OSHA has monitored hospitals for safety violations, such as: violating hazardous chemical procedures and violating infectious waste handing rules. One of OSHA's main concerns is the spread of infectious diseases, such as Hepatitis B and AIDs. Although violators that are caught face severe fines and forced to comply with regulations, those that continue unethical practices or negligent behavior often suffer the fate of costly litigation and the damages required to correct related pollution and injury.</p>
<h3>Predominant Environmental Contaminants</h3>
<h4>Medical &amp; Bio-hazardous Waste</h4>
<p>Chemotherapy chemicals, photographic solutions (from radiology departments), formaldehyde, mercury, waste from anesthetic gases, disinfectant cleaning solutions and other toxic and corrosive chemicals as well as bio-hazardous wastes.</p>
<h4>Radioactive Wastes</h4>
<p>Radioactive isotopes commonly used in research, diagnosis and treatment of various diseases, such as those associated with X-ray and laboratory processes.</p>
<h4>Wastewater</h4>
<p>Healthcare facilities face control issues beyond the federal, state and local permits and discharge requirements that apply to commercial and industrial facilities because of the hazardous and radioactive waste that they generate.</p>
<p>Structural Contaminants</p>
<p>The expanding healthcare industry faces structural contaminants such as asbestos, lead paint, mercury and PCBs in its aging buildings. Demolition, construction and renovation must be in compliance with environmental remediation plans - federal, state and local regulations place monitoring, notification and abatement burdens on facility owners and operators as well as on employers.</p>
<h4>Storage Tanks</h4>
<p>Both underground and aboveground storage tanks (USTs and ASTs) are used by healthcare facilities to store hazardous materials or chemicals, emergency generator fuels, etc.</p>
