<h4>Business Solutions Seminar Series</h4>
<p>
<b>Durham and Bates</b> is partnering with <b>COMPLI</b> (formerly Polis) to provide a
business solutions seminar series. <b>COMPLI</b> pioneers web-based workplace
compliance solutions, and helps employers address the time/cost burden and legal
liability associated with local, state and federal employment law compliance.
The company's HRProact System provides businesses the legal information and
technological infrastructure essential to efficiently manage workplace
compliance issues and streamline administrative workflow. The HRProact System will allow
human resources departments to customize, record, store, modify, distribute,
update and track all information related to employment, including personnel
policies and procedures, supervisory and HR guidebooks, training programs, and
all corporate forms related to these functions.
</p>

<p>
<b>Durham and Bates</b> believes the distinction of <b>COMPLI</b>'s program is its new level
of interactivity, allowing employees more control in the administration and
authorization of their employment-related documentation.  We've worked with
<b>COMPLI</b> to present a Fall 2001 seminar series to our customers and other business
partners.  We believe ideal firms for <b>COMPLI</b> are those that employ more than 50;
are technologically savvy, and diligent about employment practices liability.
</p>                     

<p>
Fall seminar dates are scheduled for Wednesday 11/14; and Wednesday, 12/5, from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.
All sessions will be held at Durham and Bates Agencies, Inc., 720 SW Washington, Suite 250, Portland, OR 97205.
A box lunch will be served.
