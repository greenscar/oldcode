<p><b>What is risk management?</b></p>
<p>Risk is a by-product of doing business.  Risk can be managed in a number of ways: you can take steps to avoid it, reduce it or transfer it.  Adjustments can be made to avoid certain risks all together.  Others are managed operationally by providing a safe workplace and ensuring that related organizational process and procedures are effectively managed.  Finally, some risks are managed by transferring them through insurance.  Durham and Bates specializes in managing your risk.  We bring our insurance expertise, our understanding of your business and our knowledge of risk management to the table in order to ensure the success of your business.</p>
<p><b>What is an organization's total cost of risk?</b></p>
<p>For some it would be combining the cost of premiums and retained losses for traditional insurance lines of coverage</p>
<p>A comprehensive total-cost-of-risk approach entails:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Understanding the cost drivers that affect the corporation</li>
	<li>Understanding the risks the corporation faces</li>
	<li>Understanding the corporation's goals and strategic initiatives and evaluating and applying appropriate techniques to protect the assets of the corporation</li>
	<li>Measuring and managing the process effectively</li>
	</ul>
<p>Traditional cost-of-risk management tools:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>Insurance premiums</li>
	<li> Service provider and risk transfer costs</li>
	<li> Cost of retained costs</li>
	<li> Cost of retained losses</li>
	<li> Cost of loss prevention and reduction measures</li>
	<li> Administrative cost of operating the risk management program</li>
	<li> Other consequential costs</li>
	</ul>
<p><b>What is at risk?</b></p>
<p>A company needs to not only assess the direct cost of risk, but also the consequential risks it faces as a result of a direct loss:</p>
	<ul>
	<li> Loss of market share</li>
	<li> Loss of reputation</li>
	<li> Loss of key employees</li>
	<li> Business failure of customers or suppliers</li>
	<li> Recall expenses</li>
	<li> Loss of efficiencies</li>
	<li> Warranty losses</li>  
	</ul>


<p><b>Why do you need a risk management specialist?</b></p>
<p>Understanding a company, its risks and developing a complete assessment of the cost of loss is basic risk management practice.  However, successfully implementing these practices throughout a company and making them part of the corporate culture is a job for a specialist.  We know the risks you face, how best to manage and implement them and keep you up on new developments that could impact your business.  Durham and Bates ensures the success of your business by protecting your bottom line.</p>
