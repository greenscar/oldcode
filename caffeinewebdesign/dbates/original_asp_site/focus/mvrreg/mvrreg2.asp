<br>
<p>All Employees of __________________________ must meet these standards.</p>
<p>The following policies and procedures will apply to all prospective and current employees that have access to or operate company owned vehicles:</p>
<p>1. Applicants will not be considered for employment if they:</p>
<ul>
        <li>Have been convicted of a DUI or reckless driving within the past three (3) years.</li>
        <li>Have had any combination of three (3) moving violations and/or accidents in the last three (3) years.</li>
        <li>Have had more than one (1) At Fault accident in the past three years.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. A motor vehicle record (MVR) check must be completed prior to any applicant's consideration for regular employment.</p>
<p>3. MVR's will be requested and reviewed a minimum of every twelve (12) months for all employees having access to or who operate a company owned vehicle.  This could also include employees that operate a vehicle on behalf of the company or on company business.</p>
<p>4. A current employee will be placed on six (6) months probation and be required to attend a defensive driving school, at their own expense if a MVR search reveals any combination of two moving violations and/or at fault accidents.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A third moving violation, additional at fault accident or DUI conviction may result in the loss of your privilege to operate a company owned vehicle, employment suspension or termination.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reckless use of a company owned vehicle or an at fault accident involving a company owned vehicle may result in probation, loss of company driving privileges, employment suspension or termination.</p>
<p>It is our mutual responsibility to insure, to the best of our abilities, that the company operates it's fleet as safely as possible, and this includes hiring new employees that are safe drivers and encouraging current employees to operate our and their personal vehicles in the safest possible manner.</p>
<br>
