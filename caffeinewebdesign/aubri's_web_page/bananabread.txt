   3      cups          peanut oil -- for frying
   4      cups          all-purpose flour
     3/4  cup           sugar
   4      teaspoons     baking powder
   1      teaspoon      salt
     1/2  teaspoon      ground cinnamon
     1/2  teaspoon      ground nutmeg
     1/4  cup           margarine
   1      cup           bananas -- mashed
   2                    large eggs -- beaten
                        ---- Topping: -----
     3/4  cup           sugar
   2      teaspoons     ground cinnamon

     1. Heat oil in a deep-fat fryer or deep heavy skillet.
Time heating so it will be ready when you are prepared to
begin frying doughnuts. Use Canola oil if you prefer, but
peanut oil has a higher smoking point and is a good choice
for frying.
     2. In a large bowl, combine flour, sugar, baking
powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Cut in margarine using a
pastry blender or two knives.
     3. Make a well in center of mix and add mashed bananas
and eggs. Mix well. You can do this with a wooden spoon, or
since dough will be very stiff you may want to use your
hands to mix it well.
     4. Place dough on a lightly floured surface and roll to
1/2-inch thick. Cut with a 2-1/2 inch doughnut cutter that
you dip in flour as needed.
     5. Deep-fry, a few at a time, until golden brown. Drain
on brown paper bags. Fry the doughnut "holes" also.
     6. Combine sugar and cinnamon in a paper bag or place
on a shallow plate. Coat warm doughnuts with this mixture.

Yield: about 22 doughnuts and 22 centers.
